Whether you are running on standard x86 machines, ARM-based systems, or Apple’s ARM-based processors, we have you covered.

Supported Architectures
-----------------------

The following architectures are supported:

- **linux/amd64** – The standard architecture for most 64-bit Intel/AMD processors.
- **linux/arm64** – For ARM-based 64-bit processors, commonly used in modern mobile devices, IoT, cloud environments, and ARM-based systems like the Apple M1 and M2 chips.
- **linux/ppc64le** – For IBM PowerPC 64-bit Little Endian systems, designed for high-performance computing and enterprise servers.
- **linux/s390x** – For IBM zSeries and LinuxONE mainframe processors, offering high availability and scalability in enterprise environments.

This multi-architecture support allows you to run our image seamlessly across various platforms, ensuring that your PHP applications are adaptable, scalable, and can be deployed on diverse environments without modification.
